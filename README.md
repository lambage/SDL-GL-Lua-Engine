SDL-GL-Lua-Engine
=================

A GL engine with a quake like console driven by Lua scripting and a GUI interface providing simple controls.  
Support for ttf fonts rendered using GLSL.

Working on using autoconf/automake for build system.  Then people can just use whatever editor they want and build
from the command line.
