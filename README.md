SDL-GL-Lua-Engine
=================

A GL engine with a quake like console driven by Lua scripting and a GUI interface providing simple controls.  
Support for ttf fonts rendered using GLSL.

It's currently a netbeans project, that will probably have to change, but it's very simple right now so I'm not too worried.
This is also very imcomplete from the vision that I plan on implementing.  I just wanted a place to check in for now.
